Instructions:
Write code snippets in Python, C++, and Java to demonstrate secure practices in the following areas:

    Input Validation:
        Python: Validate a user’s email input.
        C++: Validate that a user’s age is an integer within a given range (e.g., 18-65).
        Java: Validate a user’s password to ensure it meets security criteria (e.g., length, special characters).
    Authentication and Authorization:
        Python: Implement a basic token-based authentication system.
        C++: Restrict access to a resource based on user roles.
        Java: Use secure session management techniques.
    Data Sanitization:
        Python: Prevent SQL injection attacks when interacting with a database.
        C++: Sanitize user input before using it in a file operation.
        Java: Escape output to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS).

Create a summary video explanation of each area listed above.
Requirements:
Submit a Word document with all of your code. Be sure to attach your video or include a link to your video explanation.
