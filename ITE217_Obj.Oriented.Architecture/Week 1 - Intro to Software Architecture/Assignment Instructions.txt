Instructions:
For this assignment, you are tasked with coming up with a system architecture (servers, software components, and interfaces) for a streaming service. I'm sure each of you has used one or more streaming services: Netflix, Prime, AMC+, Disney+, and a whole host of others. While we haven't looked at requirements just yet, you need to think through all of the functionality that you use when viewing your favorite show, sign up, DVR functionality, etc.

    Take what you know and build an architecture.
    Use Draw.io tool, Lucidchart Intelligent Diagramming, PowerPoint, or any other service to create an appropriate architecture diagram.
    Pencil/Pen and paper is NOT acceptable for this assignment.

Requirements:
You are required to take a screenshot of your final diagram and submit in either jpg or png. Do not upload the raw file from the drawing service you use. Export into the right format or use the snipping tool in Windows for a screen capture.
