Instructions:
For this assignment, you will build the backend for a simple blog service. Building the backend for a blog service" refers to the development process of creating the server-side components that power a blogging platform. This typically includes designing and implementing functionalities such as user authentication, content management, database management, handling requests from the client-side (front end) and serving dynamic content to users. In essence, it involves creating the infrastructure and logic that enables users to write, publish, edit, and manage blog posts through the service. With an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, developers can interact with the database using objects and methods directly, without having to write SQL queries explicitly. The ORM framework handles the translation of these operations into the appropriate database queries behind the scenes.
You may use any language you would like and any database. The classes you will have include the following:

    User: typical user profile attributes
    Post: at a minimum these attributes
        Title
        Content
        Author (linked to the user who created the post)
        Publication Date

You will complete the following steps:

    Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blog posts.
    Create a list view to display all blog posts.
    Implement a detailed view to display the full content of a single blog post.

Requirements:
Submit a Word document with all of your code as well as a video explaining your code as you test it.
