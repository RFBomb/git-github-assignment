Instructions:
We've just scratched the surface of what SciKit Learn can do for us. In this assignment, you will work with an algorithm and record a video reflecting on your experience.
For this assignment, you must:

    Choose one of the different algorithms in the SciKit library other than kNN or Decision Trees. Two major ones in the kit include linear regression and random forests.
    Scour the Internet and find a public domain dataset you can use in your application and chosen algorithm.
    Answer a question related to the dataset you've chosen in the manner we did with kNN and Decision Trees.

Requirements:
Submit your dataset and code. In addition, record a video and submit it. In your video, include talking about your dataset, the question being asked, and whether or not the machine learning algorithm worked well.
