Instructions:

We have many different design patterns but there are really a few which are very important to understand:

    Singleton
    Factory Method
    Observer

Your assignment this week is to implement each of these patterns in the languages of your choice.

Requirements:

    Use at least 3 different languages.
        I would recommend C++, Java and one or more others.
        You might even consider using Javascript for one of the languages.
    You are required to write an appropriate main() or test application to exercise all of the patterns.
    You are required to record a video running and explaining each pattern.
    Don't use any of the examples in the Design Patterns in Code module.

Submit a Word document with all of your code. Be sure to attach your video or include a link to your video explanation.
